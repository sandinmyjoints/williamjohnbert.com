## Visularity ##

[Visularity](https://github.com/sandinmyjoints/visularity) is a web app for
visualizing semantic similarity that I wrote as a demo for [a talk I gave at the May 2012 DC Python Meetup](http://williamjohnbert.com/2012/05/an-introduction-to-gensim-topic-modelling-for-humans/). When
provided with data representing a large corpus of documents (for example, Wikipedia articles), Visularity will cluster words that appear in the corpus by
how close they are in meaning. This is accomplished through a technique called latent semantic analysis, implemented via
[Gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), a Python topic modelling library. For clustering, I used [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) and
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and for visualization, I used [d3.js](http://d3js.org/). To make it all work in realtime, I used
[hookbox](https://github.com/hookbox).

## Doread.me ##

In Spring 2012, I developed a web app (fancy name for a website with some
additional functionality) called [doread.me](http://doread.me) that presents a
new story every day, drawn automagically from literary journals across the
internet. (Contact me if you'd like your journal to be included.) I used
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), third-party Django apps including Zinnia
and South, and a lot of JQuery. [The source is available on github](https://github.com/sandinmyjoints/doreadme).

## Readsr ##

During the first half of 2011, I worked on a web app that tracks literary reading series in cities. It's called [Readsr](http://www.readsrs.com) and was created with [Django](http://www.djangproject.com) and various third-party apps and libraries.

## Other Web Projects ##

At any given time, I'm probably working on several web development projects. The best way to see what I'm up to is visit my [github profile](https://github.com/sandinmyjoints).

## 2011 DC Young Artist Grant ##



I was awarded a [2011 DC Young Artist Grant](http://thedcarts.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/the-commission-is-proud-to-announce-our-fy-2011-grantees/#YAP). I am immensely grateful  to the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities for this honor. My grant activities included:






	
  * Leading student writing workshops at [826DC](http://www.826dc.org) to further the development of DC's young writers.

	
  * Giving readings of my work for the DC community, including at the lowercase, a monthly reading series at [Big Bear Cafe](http://bigbearcafe-dc.com/blog/) in DC's Bloomingdale neighborhood that is sponsored by 826DC.

	
  * Submitting my stories to a number of writing contests at respected literary journals.

	
  * Attending the [Association of Writing Programs 2011 conference](http://www.awpwriter.org/conference/2011awpconf.php) in Washington, DC.

	
  * Attending a writer's retreat at [Doe Branch Ink](http://doebranchink.org/) near Marshall, North Carolina, in spring 2011.



## Call + Response ##



[Call + Response](http://www.callandresponsedc.org) is an art show pairing
writers and artists. The third installment ran from June 2-16, 2012, at
Hamiltonian Art Gallery in Washington, DC. The first one ran from January 23 to
February 13, 2010, and the second, Call + Response: Textures, ran from April 16
to April 28, 2011. 



## 826DC ##



[826DC](http://www.826dc.org) is a youth writing center that I helped found. At
various times during its existence I've been a board member (when it was
initially incorporated as Capitol Letters Writing Center), maintained its
website, thought of products and written copy for the [Museum of Unnatural
History](http://826dc.org/?page_id=24) (including all the copy for the Species
Identification Chart pictured below), and led and TAed many workshops, including
some of the ones that led to _[Get Used to the Seats](http://826dc.org/?p=510)_
and _[The Way We See It](http://826dc.org/?p=512)_. Most recently, in November
2010, I led a workshop series for middle schoolers called [_Caught in the
Act_](http://williamjohnbert.com/2010/11/caught-in-the-act-part-3/), and I
served as Secretary of the Board up through February 2011.
