## Doread.me ##

I'm currently developing a web app (fancy name for a website with some additional functionality) called doread.me that presents a new story every day, drawn automagically from literary journals across the internet. I'm using [Django](http://www.djangproject.com), third-party Django apps including Zinnia and South, a lot of JQuery, and most of my free time during January and February 2012. I plan to launch it by Spring 2012, and share the source on github.

## Readsr ##

During the first half of 2011, I worked on a web app that tracks literary reading series in cities. It's called [Readsr](http://www.readsrs.com) and was created with [Django](http://www.djangproject.com) and various third-party apps and libraries.

## Other Web Projects ##

At any given time, I'm probably working on several web development projects. The best way to see what I'm up to is visit my [github profile](https://github.com/sandinmyjoints).

## 2011 DC Young Artist Grant ##



I was awarded a [2011 DC Young Artist Grant](http://thedcarts.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/the-commission-is-proud-to-announce-our-fy-2011-grantees/#YAP). I am immensely grateful  to the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities for this honor. My grant activities included:






	
  * Leading student writing workshops at [826DC](http://www.826dc.org) to further the development of DC's young writers.

	
  * Giving readings of my work for the DC community, including at the lowercase, a monthly reading series at [Big Bear Cafe](http://bigbearcafe-dc.com/blog/) in DC's Bloomingdale neighborhood that is sponsored by 826DC.

	
  * Submitting my stories to a number of writing contests at respected literary journals.

	
  * Attending the [Association of Writing Programs 2011 conference](http://www.awpwriter.org/conference/2011awpconf.php) in Washington, DC.

	
  * Attending a writer's retreat at [Doe Branch Ink](http://doebranchink.org/) near Marshall, North Carolina, in spring 2011.



## Call + Response ##



[Call + Response](http://www.callandresponsedc.org) is an art show pairing writers and artists. The third installment will open June 3, 2012, at Hamiltonian Art Gallery in Washington, DC. The first one ran from January 23 to February 13, 2010, and the second, Call + Response: Textures, ran from April 16 to April 28, 2011.



## 826DC ##



[826DC](http://www.826dc.org) is a youth writing center that I helped found. At various times during its existence I've been a board member (when it was initially incorporated as Capitol Letters Writing Center), maintained its website, thought of products and written copy for the [Museum of Unnatural History](http://826dc.org/?page_id=24) (including all the copy for the Species Identification Chart pictured below), and led and TAed many workshops, including some of the ones that led to _[Get Used to the Seats](http://826dc.org/?p=510)_ and _[The Way We See It](http://826dc.org/?p=512)_. Most recently, in November 2010, I led a workshop series for middle schoolers called [_Caught in the Act_](http://williamjohnbert.com/2010/11/caught-in-the-act-part-3/), and I served as Secretary of the Board up through February 2011.
