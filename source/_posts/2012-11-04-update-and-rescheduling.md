[**Zero to Node**](http://www.meetup.com/Nova-Node/events/84918342/), my talk
  about writing and deploying a node.js app in production, has been rescheduled
  to Tuesday, November 6, due to Hurricane Sandy.
  
  In other news, I've redone this site using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
  with the [oct2-orange theme](https://github.com/roberto/oct2-orange). Sweet!
