By day, I’m a Software Engineer for [SpanishDict.com](http://www.spanishdict.com).

I divide the rest of my time between working on [web development projects](https://github.com/sandinmyjoints) (and asking/answering questions on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/599258/sandinymyjoints)), [writing](http://williamjohnbert.com/publications/) (mostly fiction), and other projects such as volunteering with [826DC](http://826dc.org/) and co-curating [Call + Response](http://www.callandresponsedc.org).

The official writerly bio:

William John Bert's work has appeared in Anomalous Press, Colorado Review, pacificREVIEW, and Sonora Review.  He lives in Washington, DC, where he was awarded a 2011 DC Young Artist Grant and his story "Treatment" placed second in the city's annual Larry Neal Competition. He volunteers with 826DC, a youth writing center, and he co-curates the Call + Response art series at Hamiltonian Gallery. In 2007 he earned an MFA in Fiction from the University  of Arizona's Creative Writing Program.
