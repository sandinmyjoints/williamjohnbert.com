<p>Identification with another is addictive: some of my life&#8217;s most profound, memorable experiences have come when something bridged the gap between me and another human. Because I&#8217;m a reader, this can occur across the distance of space and time. It&#8217;s happened with minor Chekov characters, and at the end of Kate Mansfield stories. It happens again and again with Norman Rush and George Saunders. The author has pushed a character through the page and connected with me on a deep level: identification.</p>


<p>Identification happens with computer programming, too.</p>


<p>I say this as a reader, writer, and programmer: I experience identification when reading and programming, and I strive to create it when writing and programming.</p>


<p>Though they deal with the messiness of reality differently, several techniques common to both disciplines enable them to achieve this mental intimacy: navigating complexity; avoiding pitfalls that inhibit communication; choosing structure wisely; harnessing expressive power; and inhabiting other minds. The Requests library, a work of computer programming by Kenneth Reitz, illustrates this.</p>

service in production</a> at the
next Nova-Node meetup, October 30 at 6:30 p.m. Below is the writeup. If it
sounds interesting to you, come by!</p>

<blockquote><p>SpanishDict recently deployed a new text-to-speech service powered by
  Node. This service can generate audio files on the fly for arbitrary Spanish
  and English texts with rapid response times. The presentation will walk
  through the design, development, testing, monitoring, and deployment process
  for the new application. We will cover topics like how to structure an Express
  app, testing and debugging, learning to think in streams and pipes, writing a
  Chef cookbook to deploy to AWS, and monitoring the application for high
  performance. The lead engineer on the project, William Bert, will also talk
  about his experiences transitioning from a Python background to Node and some
  of the key insights he had about writing in Node while developing the
  application.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s some sample code that shows the basic steps necessary to use gensim to create a corpus, train models (log entropy and latent semantic analysis), and perform semantic similarity comparisons and queries.</p>

<p><a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim</a> has an excellent tutorial, and this does not replace reading and understanding it. Nonetheless, this may be helpful for those interested in doing some quick experimentation and getting their hands dirty fast. It takes you from training corpus to index and queries in about 100 lines of code, much of which is documentation.</p>

<p>Note that this code <strong>will not work out of the box</strong>. To train the models, you need to provide your own background corpus (a collection of documents, where a document can range from one sentence up to multiple pages of text). Choosing a good corpus is an art; generally, you want tens of thousands of documents that are representative of your problem domain. Like the gensim tutorial, this code also shows how to build a corpus from Wikipedia for experimentation, though note that doing so require a lot of computing time. You could potentially <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/2012/03/how-to-install-accelerated-blas-into-a-python-virtualenv/">save hours by installing accelerated BLAS on your system</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Tuesday, I presented at the monthly DC Python meetup. My talk was an introduction to gensim, a free Python framework for topic modelling and semantic similarity using LSA/LSI and other statistical techniques. I&#8217;ve been using gensim on and off for several months at work, and I really appreciate its performance, clean API design, documentation, and community. (All of this is due to its creator, Radim Rehurek, who I interviewed recently.)</p>

<p>The presentation slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sandinmyjoints/an-introduction-to-gensim-topic-modelling-for-humans">available here</a>. I also wrote some <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/2012/05/relatively-quick-and-easy-gensim-example-code/">quick gensim example code</a> that walks through creating a corpus, generating and transforming models, and using models to do semantic similarity. The code and slides are both also available on my <a href="https://github.com/sandinmyjoints/gensimtalk">github account</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I also developed a <a href="http://github.com/sandinmyjoints/visularity">demo app to visualize semantic similarity queries</a>. It&#8217;s a Flask web app, with gensim generating data on the backend that is clustered by scipy and scikit-learn and visualized by d3.js as agglomerative and hierarchical clusters as well as a simple table and dendrogram. To make it all work in realtime, I used threading and hookbox. I call it Visularity, and it&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/sandinmyjoints/visularity">available on github</a>. You need to provide your own model and dictionary data to use&#8211;check out my presentation and visit <a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim">radimrehurek.com/gensim/</a> to learn how. Comments and feedback welcome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow at the <a href="http://meetup.dcpython.org/events/23832731/">May 2012 DC Python meetup</a>, I&#8217;m giving a talk on <a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim</a>, a Python framework for topic modeling that I use at work and on my own for semantic similarity comparisons. (I&#8217;ll post the slides and example code for the talk soon.) I&#8217;ve found gensim to be a useful and well-designed tool, and pretty much all credit for it goes to its creator, Radim Rehurek. Radim was kind enough to answer a few questions I sent him about gensim&#8217;s history and goals, and about his background and interests.</p>

<p><strong>WB: Why did you create gensim?</strong></p>

<p>RR: Consulting gig for a digital library project (Czech Digital
Mathematics Library, dml.cz), some 3 years ago. It started off as a
few loosely connected Python scripts to support the &#8220;show similar
articles&#8221; functionality. We wanted to use some of the statistical
methods, like latent semantic analysis. Originally, gensim only
contained wrappers around existing Fortran libraries for SVD, like
Propack and Svdpack.</p>

<p>But there were issues with that, and it scaled badly (all documents in
RAM), so I started looking for more scalable, online algorithms.
Running these popular methods shouldn&#8217;t be so hard, I thought!</p>

<p>In the end, I developed new algorithms for these methods for gensim.
The theoretical part of this research later turned into a part of my
PhD thesis.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work, we&#8217;re building an app to edit objects in a database&#8211;a classic CRUD
application. For now, we&#8217;re trying out ExtJS as the client-side UI
framework. One of the use cases is selecting and editing nested objects,
represented in our relational database with foreign keys. Let&#8217;s call the root
object a Task, which consists of nested Goals, which have Steps. Each of those
is defined by a model on the backend that is more or less mimicked by an
Ext.data.Model on the client-side, and each model has a proxy to a RESTful
endpoint on the backend for create/retrieve/update/delete operations. We want to
use an Ext.tree.TreePanel for the UI, so we hold the data in an
Ext.data.TreeStore. So far so good.</p>

<p>We coded up our prototype, but when a user selects a Task, Ext JS throws this
error: <code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'internalId' of
undefined</code>. Hmm. Everything seems to be working. Our models are loading the
correct data. No obvious bugs. A lot of inspecting and googling and reading
documentation later, I discover <a href="http://www.sencha.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-160068.html?s=03fb3a67ebf1e1ef856bc5f277ad12e8">this

Steve has a charming habit of introducing his readers with made-up bios, so in his honor, I asked some lowercase regulars to write fake bios of him and share them at the third anniversary reading on April 4. The results were highly entertaining; thanks to everyone who wrote one!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s mine:</p>

<blockquote><p>Steve Souryal is a group of 15 small islets and rocks in the central equatorial Atlantic Ocean. He lies in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a region of severe storms. Steve exposes serpentinized abyssal mantle peridotite and kaersutite-bearing ultramafic mylonite on the top of the second-largest megamullion in the world (after the Parece Vela megamullion under Okinotoshima in the Pacific). He is the only location in the Atlantic Ocean where the abyssal mantle is exposed above sea level! In 1986, Steve was designated an environmentally protected area, and since 1998, the Danish Navy has maintained a permanently manned research facility in him. His main economic activity is tuna fishing, and we are incredibly lucky to have him with us tonight.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Background</h2>

<p>Some mathematically intense operations that use Numpy/Scipy can run faster with accelerated basic linear algebra subroutine (BLAS) libraries installed on your system (e.g., <a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim&#8217;s</a> corpus processing).</p>

<p>To see what BLAS libraries you are using, do:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">python</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="s">&#39;import numpy; numpy.show_config()&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If none of them are installed, you probably want to install one or
more. <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> is always a good bet, since
it&#8217;s portable and self-optimizing. There are others out there targeted at
particular CPU architectures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&#8217;s the third annual Friendsgiving, a Thanksgiving-like pre-Thanksgiving event for a bunch of people who like each other; hence, Friendsgiving. Thanksgiving&#8217;s always been my favorite holiday so I&#8217;m more than happy to celebrate it twice a year. The first two Friendsgivings took place at my house, but because in the spring I traded my room in a cavernous and amply chandeliered group rowhouse for cozier and warmer digs, the honor of hosting this year falls to two friends who&#8217;re renting an entire lovely house for themselves up in Pleasant Plains. Sweet.</p>

<p>So much for traditions; recent novelties include starting a new job, about which more another time, but basically, I love it; and getting a lesson plan published in <a href="http://www.amzn.com/111802432X">Don&#8217;t Forget to Write</a>, the second volume of lesson plans from <a href="http://www.826national.org/">826</a>. The lesson plan, &#8220;Busted,&#8221; aims to make storytellers out of middle schoolers by having them write about a time they got caught doing something they shouldn&#8217;t have been doing&#8211;a theme first cooked up by the folks who led the <a href="http://826dc.org/?p=510">Get Used to the Seats</a> book project. I <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/2010/11/caught-in-the-act-part-3/">wrote about leading the workshops that ultimately became the &#8220;Busted&#8221; lesson plan</a> more than a year ago&#8211;right around the previous Friendsgiving. Hard to believe it&#8217;s been that long!</p>
