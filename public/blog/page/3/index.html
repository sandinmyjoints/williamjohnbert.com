<p>Friday, I helped out with an 826DC workshop at Bell Multicultural High School in Columbia Heights. Bell&#8217;s Poetry Club meets after school each Friday, and we came by  to work with them on metaphor. To fuel the discussion, we read &#8220;Snow Leopards at the Denver Zoo&#8221; by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Matthews_%28poet%29">William Matthews</a> (who I&#8217;d never heard of before—I&#8217;m so not a poet):</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>There are only a hundred or so
snow leopards alive, and three
of them here. Hours I watch them jump
down and jump up, water being
poured. Though if you fill a glass
fast with water, it rings high to the top,
noise of a nail driven true. Snow
leopards land without sound,
as if they were already extinct.





If I could, I’d sift them
from hand to hand, like a fire,
like a debt I can count but can’t pay.
I’m glad I can’t. If I tried to
take loss for a wife, and I do,
and keep her all the days of my life,
I’d have nothing to leave my children.
I save them whatever I can keep
and I pour it from hand to hand.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>A few metaphors there, huh? It&#8217;s a swift poem, turning from accessible to knotty in the space of a few lines. Great for discussion, and the students were more than up to the task. The writing exercise we did next further showed off their chops. We all took 20 minutes to write a poem full of metaphors, then shared them with the group. Their stuff leapt off the page, lyrical, narrative, associative, wild and subtle and everything between.</p>

<p>All of us from 826DC  were seriously impressed, and I look forward to hanging out with the Bell Poetry Club again in a couple weeks. It&#8217;s on us to come up with something new to challenge these talents—my prediction is we&#8217;re going to learn just as much as they do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/5391220127_9ed0503fb0_b.jpg"><img src="http://williamjohnbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/5391220127_9ed0503fb0_b.jpg" alt="National Portrart Gallery in the snow" /></a>Over the past couple weeks I worked on relaunching the website for <a href="http://www.callandresponsedc.org/">Call + Response</a>, an art show I co-curate with my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/kiraface">Kira</a>.</p>

<p>The website for the second iteration of the show, Call + Response: Textures, is pretty different from <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/callandresponse2010/">the first version</a>. The first was ultra minimal, hand-coded, and didn&#8217;t use a CMS—just a simple site that I could get going in a matter of hours. It was not designed to coordinate with a promotional campaign incorporating Twitter and Facebook. Even doing regular updates on our progress putting together the show would have been a real pain.</p>

<p>My goal for this site was to keep the clean, minimal feel while using a modern CMS that would allow for frequent updates, integration with social media, and cool stuff like photo galleries, maps, and interactive widgets. So here&#8217;s what I did.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First I installed  a Wordpress theme, a rather minimalist one called <a href="http://www.yukei.net/proyectos/satori-english-documentation/">sartorii</a>. Then I started to customize it to the particular needs of the site, slimming it down further, eliminating sidebars and meta information, culling whatever felt extraneous to the site&#8217;s mission of communicating essentials and focusing on the concept and participants.</p></li>
<li><p>To present the bios of the participants, I used jQuery UI&#8217;s accordion tool. Call + Response pairs artists with writers, so I wrote code to link two accordions together. When you click on an artist name you get two bios, theirs and the writer they are paired with, and vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>I installed  a lightbox plugin for the <a href="http://www.callandresponsedc.org/?page_id=65">photos page</a>. First, I discovered just how many lightbox plugins are out there. I wanted one that would integrate with Wordpress&#8217;s gallery feature, and it took some time to find a solution. I ended up using <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fancy-gallery/">Fancy Gallery</a>, which integrates with <a href="http://fancybox.net/">Fancy Box</a> to produce the desired results.</p></li>
<li><p>Once I received the poster design for the show from our designer, <a href="http://www.olivermunday.com">Oliver Munday</a>, I further customized the theme to use the poster&#8217;s colors and imagery.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m pleased with the result. I think it fulfills the goals I set forth. I learned a ton about jQuery, css, and WordPress, which was a great side benefit. Picking up new skills can be really enjoyable, especially when  those skills quickly turn into tangible results.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m already starting on my  next web development project: building a Django app to manage a list of DC-area reading series.</p>

For five minutes he puts his cornmeal voice to good use, first to list this-day-in-literature history tidbits, then to read a poem.</p>

<p>In this way I learned that three of my favorite authors, David Mitchell (the 12th), Lorrie Moore (the 13th), and Julian Barnes (today, the 19th), were born in January. That kind of news is the kind of news I want to wake up to.</p>

<p>From perusing the Writer&#8217;s Almanac&#8217;s website, I have learned that Keillor&#8217;s signature signoff, &#8220;Be well, do good work, and keep in touch,&#8221; is trademarked.</p>

<p>I won <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/2010/12/quelle-coincidence/">that Julian Barnes book</a>, by the way. Sweet. (I suspect no one else entered, for lack of publicity.)</p>

Reading Barnes makes me wish I knew some French, since he drops sentences, phrases, and occasionally passages of it, sans translation, into everything he writes, or at least everything of his that I’ve read. But I muddle through with an incomplete, partial, or guessed understanding and still find myself drawn into the stories and entranced by his command of (English) language. I&#8217;m nearly finished with Flaubert&#8217;s Parrot, and being the type of person who compulsively reads  Wikipedia entries, today I browsed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Barnes">his</a>, which in turn led me to <a href="http://www.julianbarnes.com/">his website</a>.</p>

<p>There is nothing particularly special about the website, except that there happens to be a weeklong giveaway of signed copies of his brand new short story collection, Pulse, going on. I entered. It&#8217;s easy. Too easy?</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/2010/11/old-dog-new-tricks/">old dog, new tricks</a> post, I mentioned that, though I used to blog, what you&#8217;re reading now represents my first use of Wordpress. Was it hard to set up? No. It  doesn&#8217;t hurt that I have a computer science background,  including an undergrad degree in the field. Of course, when I was in  college, web development was not part of the required CS curriculum. Standalone apps were still  dominant, so I learned Java and then C# .NET, which I used to write  black box trading systems for a couple years. During that time, I also took my first writing classes, and once I realized that software engineering was not going to be my career,  I left that job and went to grad school for writing for a  couple of years.</p>

<p>Post-grad school, I got into communications/marketing  as my day job, and of course those fields are now entwined with web  development, as websites/email/social media/etc have become the dominant  tools for organizations to get their messages out. So I find myself in the  nexus of computers and communications, which, considering my background,  seems like a natural place for me to be.</p>

<p>In my current job, I maintain a relatively simple site, using Dreamweaver to write the  standards-compliant XHTML and occasional JavaScript that the site uses.  But I want to develop and hone my skills, and starting a WordPress blog  to play around with is a step in that direction. I&#8217;ve already  customized the theme and poked around in the templates, and I&#8217;ll be  doing some more of that. My long-term plan is to learn <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and to write my own&#8211;wait for it&#8211;applications. Yes, back to application programming. But a different kind from what I learned back then, and one I&#8217;m really excited to get into.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0640.jpg"><img src="http://williamjohnbert.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0640.jpg" alt="Sign for Caught in the Act workshop in 826DC window" /></a>Tuesday night was the final workshop of the <a href="../2010/11/teaching-a-workshop-tonight/">three</a>-<a href="../2010/11/caught-in-the-act-part-2/">part</a> Caught in the Act series that I&#8217;ve been leading at <a href="http://www.826dc.org/">826DC</a>. I played trombone in high school band, and I remember the teacher telling us that the most challenging pieces weren&#8217;t the flashy <em>allegro fortissimo</em> showpieces (however much we enjoyed them) but rather the <em>lento piano</em> passages&#8211;unassuming, soft and slow, but deceptively difficult because they exposed your playing to a high level of scrutiny and vulnerability.</p>

<p>I think something similar applies to large vs. small workshops. When students far outnumber TAs, your work is cut out for you: keep circulating, keep the students on task, give as much attention to each as you can, and try to get through the whole class plan in the allotted time.</p>

<p>Teaching a very small workshop presented its own set of challenges: with everyone getting one-on-one attention, I worried the students would feel on display, over-attended-to, and uncomfortable, like patrons in an empty restaurant.</p>

<p>What I tried to do was have us all be in it together: we all sat at the same table, all did each of the exercises, and all read everyone else&#8217;s work. Did it work? I think so; the students kept coming back, anyway. And I was really impressed with the stories everyone ended up with. Truth is, I was lucky to have such a great group&#8211;students and TAs&#8211;to work with; they deserve pretty much all the credit!</p>
