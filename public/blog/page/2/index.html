  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s some sample code that shows the basic steps necessary to use gensim to create a corpus, train models (log entropy and latent semantic analysis), and perform semantic similarity comparisons and queries.</p>

<p><a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim</a> has an excellent tutorial, and this does not replace reading and understanding it. Nonetheless, this may be helpful for those interested in doing some quick experimentation and getting their hands dirty fast. It takes you from training corpus to index and queries in about 100 lines of code, much of which is documentation.</p>

<p>Note that this code <strong>will not work out of the box</strong>. To train the models, you need to provide your own background corpus (a collection of documents, where a document can range from one sentence up to multiple pages of text). Choosing a good corpus is an art; generally, you want tens of thousands of documents that are representative of your problem domain. Like the gensim tutorial, this code also shows how to build a corpus from Wikipedia for experimentation, though note that doing so require a lot of computing time. You could potentially <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/2012/03/how-to-install-accelerated-blas-into-a-python-virtualenv/">save hours by installing accelerated BLAS on your system</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Tuesday, I presented at the monthly DC Python meetup. My talk was an introduction to gensim, a free Python framework for topic modelling and semantic similarity using LSA/LSI and other statistical techniques. I&#8217;ve been using gensim on and off for several months at work, and I really appreciate its performance, clean API design, documentation, and community. (All of this is due to its creator, Radim Rehurek, who I interviewed recently.)</p>

<p>The presentation slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sandinmyjoints/an-introduction-to-gensim-topic-modelling-for-humans">available here</a>. I also wrote some <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/2012/05/relatively-quick-and-easy-gensim-example-code/">quick gensim example code</a> that walks through creating a corpus, generating and transforming models, and using models to do semantic similarity. The code and slides are both also available on my <a href="https://github.com/sandinmyjoints/gensimtalk">github account</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I also developed a <a href="http://github.com/sandinmyjoints/visularity">demo app to visualize semantic similarity queries</a>. It&#8217;s a Flask web app, with gensim generating data on the backend that is clustered by scipy and scikit-learn and visualized by d3.js as agglomerative and hierarchical clusters as well as a simple table and dendrogram. To make it all work in realtime, I used threading and hookbox. I call it Visularity, and it&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/sandinmyjoints/visularity">available on github</a>. You need to provide your own model and dictionary data to use&#8211;check out my presentation and visit <a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim">radimrehurek.com/gensim/</a> to learn how. Comments and feedback welcome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow at the <a href="http://meetup.dcpython.org/events/23832731/">May 2012 DC Python meetup</a>, I&#8217;m giving a talk on <a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim</a>, a Python framework for topic modeling that I use at work and on my own for semantic similarity comparisons. (I&#8217;ll post the slides and example code for the talk soon.) I&#8217;ve found gensim to be a useful and well-designed tool, and pretty much all credit for it goes to its creator, Radim Rehurek. Radim was kind enough to answer a few questions I sent him about gensim&#8217;s history and goals, and about his background and interests.</p>

<p><strong>WB: Why did you create gensim?</strong></p>

<p>RR: Consulting gig for a digital library project (Czech Digital
Mathematics Library, dml.cz), some 3 years ago. It started off as a
few loosely connected Python scripts to support the &#8220;show similar
articles&#8221; functionality. We wanted to use some of the statistical
methods, like latent semantic analysis. Originally, gensim only
contained wrappers around existing Fortran libraries for SVD, like
Propack and Svdpack.</p>

<p>But there were issues with that, and it scaled badly (all documents in
RAM), so I started looking for more scalable, online algorithms.
Running these popular methods shouldn&#8217;t be so hard, I thought!</p>

<p>In the end, I developed new algorithms for these methods for gensim.
The theoretical part of this research later turned into a part of my
PhD thesis.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work, we&#8217;re building an app to edit objects in a database&#8211;a classic CRUD
application. For now, we&#8217;re trying out ExtJS as the client-side UI
framework. One of the use cases is selecting and editing nested objects,
represented in our relational database with foreign keys. Let&#8217;s call the root
object a Task, which consists of nested Goals, which have Steps. Each of those
is defined by a model on the backend that is more or less mimicked by an
Ext.data.Model on the client-side, and each model has a proxy to a RESTful
endpoint on the backend for create/retrieve/update/delete operations. We want to
use an Ext.tree.TreePanel for the UI, so we hold the data in an
Ext.data.TreeStore. So far so good.</p>

<p>We coded up our prototype, but when a user selects a Task, Ext JS throws this
error: <code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'internalId' of
undefined</code>. Hmm. Everything seems to be working. Our models are loading the
correct data. No obvious bugs. A lot of inspecting and googling and reading
documentation later, I discover <a href="http://www.sencha.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-160068.html?s=03fb3a67ebf1e1ef856bc5f277ad12e8">this

Steve has a charming habit of introducing his readers with made-up bios, so in his honor, I asked some lowercase regulars to write fake bios of him and share them at the third anniversary reading on April 4. The results were highly entertaining; thanks to everyone who wrote one!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s mine:</p>

<blockquote><p>Steve Souryal is a group of 15 small islets and rocks in the central equatorial Atlantic Ocean. He lies in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a region of severe storms. Steve exposes serpentinized abyssal mantle peridotite and kaersutite-bearing ultramafic mylonite on the top of the second-largest megamullion in the world (after the Parece Vela megamullion under Okinotoshima in the Pacific). He is the only location in the Atlantic Ocean where the abyssal mantle is exposed above sea level! In 1986, Steve was designated an environmentally protected area, and since 1998, the Danish Navy has maintained a permanently manned research facility in him. His main economic activity is tuna fishing, and we are incredibly lucky to have him with us tonight.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Background</h2>

<p>Some mathematically intense operations that use Numpy/Scipy can run faster with accelerated basic linear algebra subroutine (BLAS) libraries installed on your system (e.g., <a href="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim&#8217;s</a> corpus processing).</p>

<p>To see what BLAS libraries you are using, do:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">python</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="s">&#39;import numpy; numpy.show_config()&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If none of them are installed, you probably want to install one or
more. <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> is always a good bet, since
it&#8217;s portable and self-optimizing. There are others out there targeted at
particular CPU architectures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&#8217;s the third annual Friendsgiving, a Thanksgiving-like pre-Thanksgiving event for a bunch of people who like each other; hence, Friendsgiving. Thanksgiving&#8217;s always been my favorite holiday so I&#8217;m more than happy to celebrate it twice a year. The first two Friendsgivings took place at my house, but because in the spring I traded my room in a cavernous and amply chandeliered group rowhouse for cozier and warmer digs, the honor of hosting this year falls to two friends who&#8217;re renting an entire lovely house for themselves up in Pleasant Plains. Sweet.</p>

<p>So much for traditions; recent novelties include starting a new job, about which more another time, but basically, I love it; and getting a lesson plan published in <a href="http://www.amzn.com/111802432X">Don&#8217;t Forget to Write</a>, the second volume of lesson plans from <a href="http://www.826national.org/">826</a>. The lesson plan, &#8220;Busted,&#8221; aims to make storytellers out of middle schoolers by having them write about a time they got caught doing something they shouldn&#8217;t have been doing&#8211;a theme first cooked up by the folks who led the <a href="http://826dc.org/?p=510">Get Used to the Seats</a> book project. I <a href="http://williamjohnbert.com/2010/11/caught-in-the-act-part-3/">wrote about leading the workshops that ultimately became the &#8220;Busted&#8221; lesson plan</a> more than a year ago&#8211;right around the previous Friendsgiving.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An interlude from the recent trend of hardcore Django action:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I spoke with a female intern this summer, she recounted how, in 2006, the
GNOME Project, a free and open source software project, received almost 200 Google
Summer of Code applicants. All of them were male. When GNOME advertised an
identical program for women, emphasizing opportunities for learning and mentorship
instead of tough competition, they received more than 100 highly qualified female
applicants for the three spots they were able to fund. What amazed me even more was
when she suggested that our own company slogan — “We Help the World’s Best
Developers Make Better Software” — might alienate prospective female candidates.
That had never occurred to me. But according to our intern, in the world of
computer science, “when you hear the phrase ‘the world’s best developers,’ you see
a guy.”</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <code>django-registration</code>, I was able to build a working account
registration/login system pretty easily. But I wanted to give users the ability
to use their existing accounts through popular services such as Facebook,
Twitter, etc., rather than have to create yet another account. Here&#8217;s how I did
it.</p>

<h1>Sorting Through the Choices</h1>

<p>There are a number of reusable Django apps out there to help with
registration/login from social media sites. I found this <a href="http://hackerluddite.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/review-of-4-django-social-auth-apps/">Review of 4 Django Social Auth apps</a>
very helpful in sorting out the options. After reading it, I was left to choose
between <a href="https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth"><code>django-social-auth</code></a> (I
originally linked to the wrong app here, but this link is correct) and
<a href="https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth"><code>django-allauth</code></a>. In the end, I
went with <code>django-social-auth</code> (not to be confused with <code>django-socialauth</code>)
because a friend had recommended it and because I&#8217;d already installed it before
I read this article. However, the article&#8217;s conclusion that <code>django-allauth</code> is
best out of the box also seems valid.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>The instructions in <a href="http://django-social-auth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"><code>django-social-auth</code>&#8217;s docs</a> are helpful in
walking you through available settings and options.</p>

<p>I also found the included example app useful. To use this app, I cloned
<code>django-social-auth</code>&#8217;s git repo, created a virtualenv called
<code>django-social-auth</code>, ran <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> inside this
virtualenv to install all the required apps, ran <code>manage.py syncdb</code>, and finally
ran <code>manage.py runserver</code>. Voila, example app is up and running at 127.0.0.1,
showing a simple screen with options to login through about a dozen different
different services.</p>

<h1>API Keys</h1>

<p>The first service I tested was Twitter. I use it more than any others, and I
already had the API keys for it. I threw my API key and secret key into the
example <code>local_settings.py</code> file provided with <code>django-social-auth</code> and tried to
log in via the example app. Boom: <code>401 Unauthorized</code>. I double-checked all my
settings and installation and whatnot. Seemed fine.</p>

<p>I turned my attention to the API keys. The ones I had were generated for
<a href="http://www.readsrs.com">Readsr</a>, i.e., I entered readsrs.com as the domain when
I generated them at dev.twitter.com. But now I was running on localhost,
127.0.0.1, so I suspected the readsrs.com keys wouldn&#8217;t be valid. I wasn&#8217;t sure
whether Twitter would hand over a new consumer key for 127.0.0.1, or baulk at
the request. (It seemed like it should do so, but I hadn&#8217;t seen any instructions
anywhere that said to get a key for your development machine.) Turns out Twitter
will happily give you a key for 127.0.0.1. Once I plugged the new keys in, I was
able to log in with my Twitter credentials, and just as it should,
<code>django-social-auth</code> automatically created an <code>auth.user</code> for this account.</p>

<h1>Integrating with Readsr</h1>

<p>I followed the instructions again to config my own app, Readsr. To add a login
option using Twitter credentials, I put a link to the reversed view that begins
the <code>django-social-auth</code> login process for twitter, i.e., <code>{% url
socialauth_begin "twitter" %}</code>, to my login template. And it worked.</p>

<p>I still need to fix a few oddities. For example, Twitter returns my first and
last names together in <code>first_name</code> (or else <code>django-social-auth</code> is
concatenating them into that column), and doesn&#8217;t supply any email address. But
the basic functionality is there, and was relatively easy to achieve.</p>

<h1>Postscript</h1>

<p>The author of the article I linked above had an error using OpenID when using <code>django-social-auth</code>, which is why he preferred <code>django-authall</code>. He filed a bug
for the error he got, and I notice that <a href="https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth/issues/67">it was closed</a> 15 hours ago
(though if you read the comments, it seems it was actually fixed back in
mid-July). Good timing.</p>

created a DayOfWeek model to store any particular event&#8217;s day of the week. It
contains a method next_day_of_week() to return a datetime.date object set to
the next occurrence of whatever weekday a given event instance is set to (this
helps with figuring out when the next occurrence of an event is).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easier to show through an example. On Sunday 7/3/2011:</p>

<ul>
<li>For an object with DayOfWeek set to Sunday, next_day_of_week() would return 7/3/2011 (current day).</li>
<li>For DayOfWeek set to Monday, it would return 7/4/2011 (first subsequent Monday).</li>
<li>For DayOfWeek set to Saturday, it would return 7/9/2011 (first subsequent Saturday).</li>
</ul>


<p>Sounds simple enough. It seemed like this would be a good place to do my first
unit tests.</p>

<h3>Unit Testing</h3>

<p>To do unit testing, the typical method is to first write test cases and then
write code. In this case, I&#8217;d already written my code, so I went back and wrote
test cases, trying to forget how my code worked.</p>

<p>To write test cases, you have to detail requirements for each method you want to
test: input and expected (correct) output. The list of examples for
next_day_of_week() I wrote above works for this purpose. But there&#8217;s a catch:
next_day_of_week() calculates the next day of the week relative to the
current date, by calling datetime.date.today(). So if I write expected output
for 7/3/2011, it will no longer be the correct output on 7/4/2011 or any
following day. I needed a way to make datetime.date.today() always spit out my
input date when I run tests, yet still continue to function normally outside of
testing. Enter mocking.</p>

<h3>Mocking</h3>

<p>The solution was to mock out the method&#8211;to replace the real
datetime.date.today() with a fake one that produces the same output no matter
what day it is. To accomplish this, I used the powerful <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/">Mock
library</a>. Specifically, I needed to
use the patch decorator. This decorator makes it really easy to replace on
particular object within the scope of a particular method.</p>

<p>Before I could patch the today() method, I needed to create my own fake
method. It would look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">faketoday</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2011</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&#8217;s a problem, though, when I try to patch (or mock out) the method:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><code>datetime.date</code> is considered a Python built-in and can&#8217;t be modified.</p>

<h3>Modifying a Class That Can&#8217;t Be Modified</h3>

<p>The trick is to write a child class that can be modified, and thus faked:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">FakeDate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">date</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s">&quot;A fake replacement for date that can be mocked for testing.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__new__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cls</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__new__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">date</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All this does is create a class whose constructor returns an instance of its
parent&#8217;s class, date. Usually, this would be pointless, but it&#8217;s useful here
because the new class isn&#8217;t a built-in and thus can be mocked.</p>

<p>To use it, we simply decorate any test method that calls datetime.date.today()
with a patch to replace datetime.date with FakeDate, and we also provide
FakeDate a fake today() method that returns only and always the particular we
are going to use for testing:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">new_day_of_week</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">day</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;SU&quot;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A couple things to note: the patch only applies within this particular method,
so each method to use a patch must be decorated. Also, the real datetime.date is
imported in the method so we can use it inside the fake today() method. We could
put this fake today() method inside FakeClass, but making it a lambda
(anonymous) method assigned inside the test case gives us the flexibility to set
a particular date for each test case.</p>

<h3>Namespacing</h3>

<p>You may be wondering why the patch decorator takes &#8220;series.models.date&#8221; as the
method to replace instead of &#8220;datetime.date&#8221;. That was how I tried it at first,
and I was confused when it didn&#8217;t work. It seemed as if the patch hadn&#8217;t taken
effect.</p>

<p>Well, it hadn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s because within the module being tested (models.py in the
series app, or series.models in Python dotted notation), date has been imported
like so:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">datetime</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">date</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This means that within series.models, date is now available as
series.models.date, so that&#8217;s the name that needs to be mocked out. For more on
namespacing when mocking, checked out <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/patch.html#id2">Mock&#8217;s Where to patch documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Now we can supply out unit tests with any date we want, ensuring that we know
what the results should be and can test against them.</p>

<p>Learning how to do this stuff, I posted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6575687/how-do-i-use-mocking-to-test-a-next-day-of-week-function">my first question at Stackoverflow</a>
(I ended up answering it myself). I also learned about using a fake class <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4481954/python-trying-to-mock-datetime-date-today-but-not-working">from this question</a>. Finally,
the <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/index.html">Mock documentation</a> was
very helpful as well.</p>
