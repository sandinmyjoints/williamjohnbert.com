    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I spent some time wrestling with the notorious
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript">same origin policy</a>
in order to get CORS
(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">cross-origin resource sharing</a>)
working in Chrome for development work I was doing between two applications
running on localhost. Setting the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header to <code>*</code>
seemed to have no effect, and
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67743">this bug report</a>
nearly led me to believe that was due to a bug in Chrome that made CORS with
localhost impossible. It&#8217;s not. It turned out that I also needed some other
CORs-related headers: <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> and
<code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code>.</p>

<p>This (slightly generalized) snippet of <a href="http://expressjs.com">Express.js</a>
middleware is what ended up working for me:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">app.all("/api/*", function(req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Cache-Control, Pragma, Origin, Authorization, Content-Type, X-Requested-With");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, PUT, POST");
  return next();
});
</code></pre>

<p>With that, Chrome started making OPTIONS requests when I wanted to POST from
localhost:3001 to localhost:2002. It seems that using <code>contentType:
application/json</code> for POSTs forces CORS preflighting, which surprised me since
it seems like a common case for APIs, but no matter:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">app.all("/api/*", function(req, res, next) {
  if (req.method.toLowerCase() !== "options") {
    return next();
  }
  return res.send(204);
});
</code></pre>
