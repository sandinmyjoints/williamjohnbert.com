<p>So I&#8217;m actually not new to blogging&#8211;I blogged for about a year from 2003-2004 and, though it may lead to embarrassment, I&#8217;ll even link to the old thing, which is still up: <a href="http://pleonasticephemera.blogspot.com/">Pleonastic Ephemera</a>. (I&#8217;ve also participated in several private group blogs for sharing writing with geographically-dispersed friends.)</p>

<p>Pleonastic Ephemera was on Blogspot, which is a great tool for getting blogs up quickly with ease and minimal back-end configuration, while this blog represents my first foray into the more complex WordPress platform. WP is built around PHP scripts, which I&#8217;ve haven&#8217;t worked with much before, but it&#8217;s easy to pick it up thanks to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org">WordPress&#8217;s copious documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve played around with a few themes, and chosen this one for the moment, though I&#8217;m still looking for one that really grabs me. I&#8217;ve customized this one  a bit and will probably do more of that, which is part of my larger goal: to bring my web development skills up to date with some contemporary languages and platforms. PHP and WordPress are a first step in that direction, but I&#8217;ll post much more about my background, motivation, and plans next week.</p>
