    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An interlude from the recent trend of hardcore Django action:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I spoke with a female intern this summer, she recounted how, in 2006, the
GNOME Project, a free and open source software project, received almost 200 Google
Summer of Code applicants. All of them were male. When GNOME advertised an
identical program for women, emphasizing opportunities for learning and mentorship
instead of tough competition, they received more than 100 highly qualified female
applicants for the three spots they were able to fund. What amazed me even more was
when she suggested that our own company slogan — “We Help the World’s Best
Developers Make Better Software” — might alienate prospective female candidates.
That had never occurred to me. But according to our intern, in the world of
computer science, “when you hear the phrase ‘the world’s best developers,’ you see
a guy.”</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="Morning comes to Columbia Heights"]<a href="http://myamcommute.tumblr.com/post/1620568222/william-29-washington-dc-sunrise-comes-to"><img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lc5efzo5Cd1qelrpbo1_500.jpg" alt="Early morning sunlight on buildings in Columbia Heights" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Fellow 826DC volunteer and all-around awesome person <a href="http://myamcommute.tumblr.com/">Anna started a Tumblr</a> to collect photos of people's morning commutes. I thought that was a great way to turn what can be one of a day's most unremarkable stretches into something seen anew, so I contributed a <a href="http://myamcommute.tumblr.com/post/1620568222/william-29-washington-dc-sunrise-comes-to">couple</a> <a href="http://myamcommute.tumblr.com/post/1648509699/william-29-washington-d-c-museum-of-unnatural">photos</a> and plan to send more. At the moment (Happy Thanksgiving!) several of the commute photos involve seriously beautiful skyscapes.</p>
